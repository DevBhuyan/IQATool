Satellite and Aerial imagery are prone to various kinds of noise artefacts due to the huge distance, obstructions in the medium, and imaging technologies. Most satellites nowadays use SAR imaging techniques, which are prone to a special kind of noise known as speckle noise. Many techniques are being developed to get rid of this kind of noise. This application helps us simulate the various kinds of noises that can creep into satellite images at varying degrees. Additionally, a CNN based noise removal technique has been utilized to clean noisy images. It also includes a feature for batch processing of multiple images to compute the `CNR` and `ENL` metrics over a designated RoI.

[This video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UOSz-HT0VwgQWhQ4evnvhHo44FL-Ly90/view?usp=sharing) shows another example with some updated features.

Run "IQATool.m" to start the application, and then you can start playing with the app using the buttons. The videos above show examples for usage. Feel free to play around with the application or the code. Do not forget to change the original directory locations.

You can also fork this repository and modify the code to build your own version.

This was built as a part of my internship at NITK, Surathkal. Here's a brief [presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dJ1Wp9j8stq3N8jjTTRp6ZfTc9ESdnQp/view?usp=sharing) about the internship
